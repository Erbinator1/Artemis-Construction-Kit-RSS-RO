# benjee10_Orion RSS/RO Compatibility
This config provides compatibility with benjee10's new Orion spacecraft mod and RSS/RO.

This config was made compiling the work of ROCapsules and SpaceLaunchSystem Parts Pack. This work was not done by me, merely adopted from other configs to adapt benjee10's Orion.<br>
<br>If there are any issues with this, please inform me and I will take it down.  

This config has support for RSS/RO, RealAntennas and **SOME** support for TACLS. I do not use TACLS so YMMV.
