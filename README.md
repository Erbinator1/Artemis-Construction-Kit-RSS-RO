# Artemis-Construction-Kit-RSS-RO
This config provides compatibility with benjee10's new Orion and SLS parts for RSS/RO.

This config was made compiling the work of ROCapsules and SpaceLaunchSystem Parts Pack. This work was not done by me, merely adopted from other configs to adapt benjee10's Orion for RSS/RO. I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THEIR WORK.<br>
<br>If there are any issues with this, please inform me and I will take it down.  

This config has support for RSS/RO, RealAntennas and **SOME** support for TACLS. I do not use TACLS so YMMV.   
I have also added a branch for people who do not wish to have TACLS parts on the craft. Just select the no-TACLS branch and download the source code.

# Dependencies
[Benjee10_Orion](https://github.com/benjee10/Benjee10_Orion) and its dependencies  
[RealSolarSystem](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealSolarSystem)   
[RealismOverhaul](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul)   

# Soft-Dependencies
[ROEngines](https://github.com/KSP-RO/ROEngines)   
(Only install my edit if you want the mounting points from ACK. Otherwise use the NON-RO engine. More details in **Known Issues**)   
# Extras   
**To use Bluedog Design Bureau's SLS ICPS, head to SovietOnion's Repository [here](https://github.com/SovietOnion1608/RealismOverhaul/tree/BDB-RO-Configs)**   

# Installation
Unzip the contents of zip file to your KSP Main directory.<br><br>
File structure:  
* Kerbal Space Program  
  * GameData  
    * ROConfigs
    * ROEngines (Only install this version if you want mounting nodes from ACK)  

# Known Issues   
* RS-25 mount textures do not show up for ROEngines, but does for the one included in ACK. The engine included with ACK **IS** configured for RO, but will say NON-RO. I cannot remove the NON-RO status without the engine being removed altogether. I have made it so the mounts are the same across ROEngines and ACK.   
# Issues
This config is very much a WIP. This is my first public config so if you have any issues, let me know in the issues tab.
