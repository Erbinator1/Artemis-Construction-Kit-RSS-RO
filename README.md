# benjee10_Orion RSS Compatibility
This config provides compatibility with benjee10's new Orion spacecraft mod and RSS/RO.

Configured by Erbinator
This config was made compiling the work of ROCapsules and SpaceLaunchSystem Parts Pack. This work was not done by me, merely adopted from other configs to adapt benjee10's Orion. If there are any issues, please inform me and I will take it down.
